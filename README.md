# Spycrow: The Ultimate Stealth Experience

A stealth game prototype where the player has the control of a crow and must eat all the pumpkins without getting caught by the scarecrows.

This game has a lot of inspiration in different games and was developed with the solely purpose of learning Unity.

## How to Play

Use AWSD keys to move to player. You must reach the tile with the pumpkin to eat it. Remember to avoid the view from the scarecrows using the grass tiles to finish the mission!

Tip: pay attention to the "eye icon" on the left! When you are on a grass tile, it will show that you are invisible to the scarecrows, so use this as an advantage in your mission.

## What about the graphics?

My focus was 100% on the programming side of the game, because the main goal of this game was to learn more about how Unity works.

That's way the player is still a black sphere and there is a lack of visual elements during the gameplay.
